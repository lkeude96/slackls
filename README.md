# slackls

## MVP

User can view a DM history with `ls`

  * CLI args
    * linux command (ls|cd|echo)
    * organization (turingschool)
    * user (tmikeschu | seamus)
  * HTTP
  * Slack API
  * Environment Variables

```
ls turingschool seamus

> Seamus Quinn [8:50 PM] You want to slack call?

> Mike Schutte [8:50 PM] Started a call 
> Seamus Quinn [8:59 PM] https://prod.liveshare.vsengsaas.visualstudio.com/join?B93E137AF49BAE27C4F7A4CE2DDFA3ADCEEA
```

## Parking Lot

  * Named arguments (as opposed to positional)
    * i.e. `-o`
  * CLI Login Prompt
